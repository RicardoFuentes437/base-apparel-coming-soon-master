## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Javascript

### What I learned

It was interesting to work a little bit more with Javascript for this project, i learned more about the Event Listeners, for example id didn't know there was an EL for when a form is submitted, that one was really helpful in this challenge.

### Continued development

I would like to learn more about all the different kind of Event Listeners that exist, so that i can use them in future projects, depending on what the task i need to complete is.

### Useful resources

- [Submit Event Listener](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLFormElement/submit_event) - This helped me understand how the submit event works and the things i can do with it.
